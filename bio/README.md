Managing teams remotely is challenging, but how do you ensure that you are setting the right company culture in your remote teams when your business is scaling rapidly?
Even though NearForm have a ten year history of being a remote first organisation, over the past year the company has doubled in size, and is still growing. As a result of this, new team management systems have had to be put in place to help support our teams and ensure we are still able to provide a culture of openness, innovation and quality.  From devising a system of Pod Management, to creating clearly defined careers paths, I would like to take you through some of the techniques our Engineering Management team have used so other leaders can learn how it really is possible to create a remote culture that feels like home to Engineers.
