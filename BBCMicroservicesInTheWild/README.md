# BBC - Microservices in the wild

## Abstract
A few years ago, the BBC realised if they were to continue to be able to a major player in the digital entertainment space, they needed to evolve the ways in which they worked. Moving from single monolithic codebases; which struggled to scale to the large numbers of users that we were aiming to attract; to a more microservice based architecture; which allow multiple independent teams to develop faster, leaner code; has been an interesting process. Adopting these ways of working has allowed us to create a more unified experience for our users, whilst giving us the capacity to allow more developers working towards common goals. The benefits of microservices are well documented but I will also discuss some of the pitfalls with this way of working, and how the BBC work around them.


### Questions I want to answer in this talk

Why did the BBC move to using microservices architectures?

How did the K&L move to using microservice architectures?

What are the pitfalls we have come across, and how have we managed to over come them?

### Things I want to cover

How different BBC services work together to create a product.  Use examples - personalisation using UAS and myBBC in pages such as Food and on the Bitesize App.

Worth mentioning the team strucutres and sizes  - so we have multiple small teams, micro working on micro services.  

How nitro and Orb / orbit are used by pages.  How different teams can look after these

How sometimes we have "must update now" to latest versions (move from Orb to Orbit) - and yes this can be an inconvenience, however, we get a lot of benefits.

Problem of communication - ensuring that we don't reinvent the wheel.

Specialists working on specific areas of the sites - allows developers more scope to work on / improve the areas which they are working on.

Use of microservices in products - Bitesize app and how that is put together.

Use of Morph - how this works.

Problems with microservices - dev ops.  Keeping the serives pure.

The future - use of lambdas and where these can be used.
