# Abstract

Microservices seem to be the flavour of the month, but can they be successfully applied in practice?  

The BBC have been using Microservice architectures successfully for a number of years across a number of different projects. 


## Questions i want to answer in this talk

Why did the BBC move to using microservices architectures?

How did the K&L move to using microservice architectures?

What are the pitfalls we have come across, and how have we managed to over come them?
