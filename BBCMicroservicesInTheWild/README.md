# BBC - Microservices in the wild

## Abstract

The BBC have been using Microservice architectures successfully for a number of years, but how do they put the theory of microservice architectures into practice?  This talk will go through the practical applications of microservices at the BBC, and how we moved from monolythic architectures to the microservice model.  It will also highlight some of the pitfalls and how the BBC have worked to get around them. 


### Questions I want to answer in this talk

Why did the BBC move to using microservices architectures?

How did the K&L move to using microservice architectures?

What are the pitfalls we have come across, and how have we managed to over come them?

### Things I want to cover

How different BBC services work together to create a product.  Use examples - personalisation using UAS and myBBC in pages such as Food and on the Bitesize App.

Worth mentioning the team strucutres and sizes  - so we have multiple small teams, micro working on micro services.  

How nitro and Orb / orbit are used by pages.  How different teams can look after these

How sometimes we have "must update now" to latest versions (move from Orb to Orbit) - and yes this can be an inconvenience, however, we get a lot of benefits.

Specialists working on specific areas of the sites - allows developers more scope to work on / improve the areas which they are working on.

Use of microservices in products - Bitesize app and how that is put together.

Use of Morph - how this works.

Problems with microservices - dev ops.  Keeping the serives pure.

The future - use of lambdas and where these can be used.
