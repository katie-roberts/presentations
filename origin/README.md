# How i became a developer

## My first computer

BBC Model B - I learned basic from the back of computer magazines and by teaching myself to convert The Beatles back catalogue into a series of beeps.  I inadvertantly invented electronic music in the early 80's!  I still remember the shere delights of Elona Rigby in through the four independent sound channels (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).


## And then the years of silence ...

I didn't start programming again until the mid 90s.  I was sharing an office with a programmer who only talked about programming and Phil Collins, so I learnt to programme.

## Director, Liberate, Actionscript ... Bring out your dead (languages)

I did my MA in 2004 where I learned to use Director  - particulally 3D Lingo to create interactive worlds (https://vimeo.com/15815155).
I worked at Playjam, London developing games for the Liberate platform (used in cable TV boxes).
I worked at Wonderman, London developing interactive applications in Actionscript for Advertising purposes.

## BBC 

I started working for the BBC in 2012 - working on the IPTV Digital Olympics offering (javascript).  Since then I have worked as a devekioer on the Music Events app (Everett) for Virgin Boxes (actionscript), Sportacus - the back end service that drives the BBC IPTV sports app (Java), 

I became Development Lead for Knowledge and Learning in 2015 and since then I have been involved with the production of BBC Food, Bitesize App (iOS and Android), and the science project Terrific Scientific along side continued work on iWonder, Timeslines and Genres sites.
