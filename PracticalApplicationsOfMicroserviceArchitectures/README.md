# Practical Applications of Microservice Architectures at the BBC

# Abstract

Microservices archetectures seem to be an attractive proposition, but can they be successfully applied in practice?  

The BBC have been using Microservice architectures successfully for a number of years across a number of different projects. 


## Questions I want to answer in this talk

Why did the BBC move to using microservices architectures?

How did the K&L move to using microservice architectures?

What are the pitfalls we have come across, and how have we managed to over come them?

## Things I want to cover

How different BBC services work together to create a product.  Use examples - personalisation using UAS and myBBC in pages such as Food and on the Bitesize App.

Worth mentioning the team strucutres and sizes  - so we have multiple small teams, micro working on micro services.  

How nitro and Orb / orbit are used by pages.  How different teams can look after these

How sometimes we have "must update now" to latest versions (move from Orb to Orbit) - and yes this can be an inconvenience, however, we get a lot of benefits.

Specialists working on specific areas of the sites - allows developers more scope to work on / improve the areas which they are working on.

Use of microservices in products - Bitesize app and how that is put together.

Use of Morph - how this works.

Problems with microservices - dev ops.  Keeping the serives pure.

The future - use of lambdas and where these can be used.
